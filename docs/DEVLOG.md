## Development Log

### [Current Date] - Project Kickoff
**Session Goal**: Build MVP in one night  
**Team**: Solo developer hackathon

#### Decisions Made
- Chose PWA over native app for faster deployment
- Using Web Speech API instead of Whisper for MVP
- Supabase for quick backend setup
- Skipping ESLint for speed
- Using Turbopack for faster HMR

#### Setup Completed
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest find-five --typescript --tailwind --app --src-dir --no-eslint
npm install @supabase/supabase-js zustand next-pwa framer-motion recharts
```

#### Architecture Decisions
- Zustand for state management (simpler than Redux)
- PWA-first approach to avoid app store complexity
- Offline-first with sync queue pattern

#### Progress
- ✅ Project initialized
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ✅ CLAUDE.md created for AI assistance
- ⏳ Database schema creation
- ⏳ Basic UI components

#### Lessons Learned
